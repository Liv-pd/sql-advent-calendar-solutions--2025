-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select e.elf_name, case when v.return_date is null then 'Still resting'
  else cast(v.return_date AS VARCHAR)
  end as return_date_edited
from elves AS e left join vacations AS v ON e.elf_id = v.elf_id
